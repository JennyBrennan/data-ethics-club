### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday the 20th January at [13:00-14:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club&iso=20210120T13&p1=%3A&ah=1). You don't need to register, just drop in. This time we're going to watch/read the [Executive Summary of the Review into bias in algorithmic decision making](20-01-20_cdei_algorithmic_bias_summary.pdf) by the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), which is a recently published (end of November 2020) government report. 

Natalie suggested this week's content, and will be leading this week's meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like (relating to the content), but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Were you surprised by any of the examples of algorithmic decision making currently in use?
- Which of the CDEI's recommendations do you agree/disagree with?
- Are there any recommendations that you think are missing?
