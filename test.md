### What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying a new thing: writing up our thoughts about the paper collaboratively.
We hope you'll join us in this experiment! 
The idea is to try to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view - if you want them to be!

And we also hope that through doing this, we'll learn how to write collaboratively across this very geographically dispersed group with different backgrounds. 
We hope that will prepare us to collaborate on a perspective article later - if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: New sentences on new lines
One thing to keep in mind is that it's good to write every sentence on a new line. 
This helps us to keep track of what's being written in different versions of the documents.
On the left ("edit mode") these sentences are on new lines, but on the right ("view mode") they're on the same line.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the very top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

## Discussion
We split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### **Writing things down is optional**
Like I said, this document is an experiment: we want to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

Please try to summarise other's points accurately.
You all have the power to edit, so feel free to rephrase.

Suggestions for what to write down:
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about
