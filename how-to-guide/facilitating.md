# Suggestiosn for facilitating a Data Ethics Club meeting

The detail included here is what has worked for us in planning and running our meetings. Feel free to replicate it, or just take ideas that are helpful to you. Typically we have a brief introduction to the material, split everyone into breakout rooms of 5-6 people for 25-30 minutes to talk about the discussion questions, and then come back together for the final 15-20 minutes to share thoughts before voting on the material for the next meeting. 

We use the collaborative markdown site [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) to collect everyone's views on the content whilst we're in breakout rooms. Our templates for this are linked below.  

## A note on facilitators
- Ideally you need **two facilitators** so that one can focus on talking and the meeting content, and one can focus on practical things like admitting people into the meeting and organising breakout rooms.  
- Facilitators do not need to be data ethics experts. It is more important that they can encourage others to speak and can manage dicussions.  

## Before the meeting
- Choose the material to discuss from the reading list. We suggest voting on this in the previous meeting!  
- Decide on three questions around the piece to discuss.  
- Set up communications and information on the repository using the meeting template, and then circulate it a week before (see email template).  
- Update the overall meeting page with this information.   
- Set up a new HackMD document for collaborative writing in the meeting. A template is available here.   
- Send an on-the-day reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions.  
- Have a 3-minute verbal summary of the material ready in case nobody in the meeting is prepared to volunteer one.  

## Meeting Structure
Meetings are typically 1 hour.  
  
0-5 mins   
  - Allow people to trickle in and say hi.  
5-15 mins   
  - Welcome everyone to the meeting. Post a link to the Code of Conduct/the HackMD collaborative document and do a quick reminder of any key points.  
  - Once everyone has arrived, invite a 3 minute summary of the content for discussion (not everyone will have had a chance to read it). If no one volunteers you may need to do this yourself!  
  - Briefly introduce the HackMD document, and show attendees where they can find the discussion questions.  
  - Allocate people randomly into breakout rooms, with 5-6 people in each group.   
15-40 mins  
  - Attendees chat amongst themselves. Facilitators can join the chats, but keep an eye on the main room for any latecomers who need to be assigned to a breakout room.  
40-55 mins  
  - Bring everyone back to the main room and invite summaries from each group. Hopefully this will provoke some discussion (we usually find we run out of time because of it!).  
55-60 mins  
  - Run a feedback poll (we use Zoom but you could use Mentimeter or another tool) and find out...  
    - a) Did the material provoke interesting discussion?  
    - b) Would you recommend this piece to another group?  
  - Run a poll on material for next time. It's usually best to choose a shortlist of three or so items and let everyone vote on them.   

## After the meeting
- The HackMD document is the main output of the meeting, and hopefully the groups will have recorded their thoughts in it as they discussed the material. It's up to you what to do with it, but we like to use it to produce a summary of what we talked about so we can share it with others or remind ourselves!  
- Update the meeting template with the outcome of the poll and a link to the summary document.  
- Move the meeting on the overall meeting list, and make the next one!
