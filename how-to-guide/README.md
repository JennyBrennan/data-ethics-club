# How to (re)use the Data Ethics Club repository

One of our hopes in making this repository is that other people can reuse it to run their own Data Ethics Clubs. In this folder you will find information about how to organise and facilitate Data Ethics Club, including using the templates we've provided for organising and communication. This information is based on what we have learned since starting and time we've spent developing the repository as a resource; we hope its useful! The repository is licensed with a [CC-BY 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode), which means we welcome other re-using and re-mixing what they find here, but please attribute this repo.
