# Ethical Data Science Journal Club 
:computer: :brain: :bar_chart: :sparkles:

A reading list designed to provoke discussion about ethical applications of, and processes for, data science. Based in Bristol, but open to all.

## Organisation
At the moment, we would love suggestions for reading/viewing materials. If you'd like to help organise, please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk). 

When the club emerges from it's chrysalis :bug: :butterfly:, we'll advertise it through the [Jean Golding Institute mailing list](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/join-our-mailing-list/), we'll advertise the dates right here, and I'll [tweet about it at #DataEthicsClub](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataEthicsClub?src=hashtag_click).
