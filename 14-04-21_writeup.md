### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

We also hope that through doing this, we'll open up the possibility for more collaborative writing together in the future, e.g. through a perspective article.
That's if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.

## Discussion
Each week, we split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### Writing things down is optional
This document is an experiment to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

The following are all good options:
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here as you discuss.
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here up to a week after the discussion at any time.
- :heavy_check_mark: Not writing any notes in here at any time.

#### What to write
Suggestions for what to write down (if you want to):
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about

### Discussion

#### Suggested Questions

- **Q1**: What did you think about the suggested topics (Annex B)? Is there anything there that you think deserves a particular highlight, or anything that you feel is particularly missing? Do you use any particular tools/frameworks for assessing the ethics of your own work?
- **Q2**: What kinds of positive changes do you think it’s possible for the UK Statistics Authority to influence? Are these kinds of resources useful to you in your work, or merely a box-ticking exercise? What do you think would be most useful to you in making your area of work more ethical?
- **Q3**: Did you notice any gaps in the applied data ethics landscape (Annex A)?

#### Room 1

Summary:
Slightly off-topic... broader data ethics topics. Absent:
- Ethics training
- Ethics committee
- Ethics support

What's the boundary between AI and statistics ? Statistics will still impact people. 

Should be ethics by design. 

##### Q1
- Question 7 really important. The temptation to think of research and statistics as being separate from the real world and so there being no need for building ethical issues in until the operational side comes in must be wrong. There must be training that ensures ethics is part of the process from the start. There just isn't a hard boundary between research and the operationalisation of it. 
- This ties back to Q2, the ask that researchers should be able to articulate the public good of their work. 
- Basic questions to ask upfront: Why collect data on a topic that you cannot change? What are we going to do with that data?

##### Q2 
- People are not taught how much harm can be done by getting decisions wrong, mis-design of projects or analysis. Training how to build in this thinking at the start of projects, not just after the fact, would be really valuable.

##### Q3


##### Misc
- Ethics by design crucial - not appropriate to complete a project and then send it for approval by an ethics commmission, should have ethical principles 'baked in' from the start
- Gaps in Annex A - several organisations lack resources in the three columns 'User Ethics Training', 'User Ethics Support', 'Ethics Committee'. It seems like the Statistics Authority is seeking to carve out a role for itself in these areas - filling these perceived gaps.
- It is not just down to individuals. There is a need for ethical issues to be embedded at organisations as a whole -- is there enough in the outline about organisations and their overall culture? There is only so much an individual can do without a supportive culture.

#### Room 2

##### Summary
Themes of taking more personal responsibility for ethics.
Need for a broader range of input on ethics issues. 
Training is an issue this body could do something about - how do people recognise when there is an ethical question? They might not realise 
People don't aim to be bad. 
Document was a bit unweildly. Think they could use wider language (e.g. apply to analysts) and be more operational. There is a lot a fear in terms of legal implications. 
Would like to see more on wider societal impacts. 

##### Q1
- Caution, language needs to be broader to include analysts, like the police, the NHS, etc. It's not research, so don't always use ethics frameworks.
- Research is very focused on immediate effects, not the future possibilities and wider social effects. (Link to Point 7, Annex B)
- "Once you build a machine to do something, it's difficult to persuade people not to use it" (check quote)  
- It's gone through ethics. Ethics is tick-boxy, legal not ethical.
- Refers briefly about reviewing ethics throughout not just a one-off.

- There's already a lot of resources on a lot of these topics. We'd like to see more challenging questions addressed that focus on looking forwards and considering how research might impact broader society.
- Involving lay people, co-creating research with the people who are affected, e.g. Autism 
- Relational ethics. Research ethics isn't just doing the science you were going to do anyway, but "ethically", but also deciding what you're going to do.
- Scientism = doctrine of science being the absolute arbiter. Science = the truth. (Currently seems a little bit less embarrassing in some ways, but maybe what I'm looking at/echo chamber).
-
##### Q2
- Increasingly emphasise & embed impact of ethics on day-to-day science, as opposed to outsourcing decisions to ethics committees. 
- Ethics more tied-in to day-to-day work - change the way we train people. Build the ethics committee in my head: what is a consideration, and not just totally outsourcing it.
    - Let's train people! Let's invite the public more!
    - And from other view points! Laypeople, doctors, different people.
- In ethics committees, you can't take a punative attitute otherwise people won't come to you. And people are horrified that their research is causing problems, so it's their lack of training/their lack of the right viewpoint to be able to notice the prblem. 
- Later in careers, it's scary to admit you haven't thought about things - people can get quite abrasive and defensive.
- We think of ourselves as good poeple, so think of course our decisions will be good.
- As a body, could the Applied Data Ethics Centre work on embedding ethics training much earlier in people's training. 
- It's difficult to find spaces to really talk about your work in detail.
- "Subjective preference"? - e.g. colour blind - if something really really matters to a group of people who are not necessarily well-represented. Including them in the process is very important.
- The telephone, the typewriter, text-to-speech, email, all designed initially for people for disabilities: forced to do good things for everyone

##### Q3


##### Misc

#### Room 3

##### Summary
- Would be helpful to have somewhere to point at the start of a project. 
- RSE's (& other research roles) should all have this knowledge, even if just signposting.
- Covers mostly government - would be good to more commercial and research organisation. 

##### Q1
- It's notable how specifically GIS data has been specifically called out and in a different style than all the others. What is the question being asked here? It sort of feels tacked on the end. What about is isn't covered by the other spaces in Appendix B.
- Understandable the lack of consequences when not following guidelines given the remit of the organizations. Need to include that this prospective measures at the start of projects rather than at the end.
- We need to get legistlature start to catch up
- Where is the accountability and ownership at lots of different levels

##### Q2
- Hope to take it in-house and some folks to standardize their evaluation procedures.
- Useful for RSE's to point towards best practices.
- This is a bit hard given that the complexity

##### Q3
- Auto-scale textbox sizing so that one can read stuff
- Formal listing for University research
- Need more input from other individuals. Curious to see if there was any consulting. West Midlands...
- Where is the technical research in commercial spaces?
- Also organizational research.


##### Misc
- Need to look into the Statistical Authority report itself and strategy document to better understand what is driving this "ORG."

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, I'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then I'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.
We'll also send it to the UK Statistics Authority!

## Feedback on the format
Please feel free to leave us some notes below on how the discussion group went for you this time, positive or negative, and any suggestions to improve (you can always [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) instead).
