# Data Ethics Club discusses "#bropenscience is broken science"

## We know the bro
Those of us who are within or adjacent to the Open Science and tech communities recognised the bro (and sadly the bro within), in all genders. For example centring socialisation around beer or "joking" about why some piece of software is terrible. 
Over all, there seemed to be some hope for redemption for this flavour of bro, with a few tales of improvement. 
Despite the name, we felt that being a bro isn't necessarily about masculine versus feminine, but about naming your viewpoint as The One Way To Do Things, about superiority for an elite group, as [this article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6502624) suggests with respect to bros in computer science. 
This is borne out by [other examples](https://joelemartinez.com/2016/12/28/whiteness-in-statistics/) of dismissive attitudes in Open Science.

## It's bros all the way down
Whether attendees were inside of, familar with, or unfamiliar with, the Open Science community, many said #bropenscience reminded them of the wider problems of academia. 
We see it when someone makes a derisive "more of a comment than a question" in a conference Q+A, when reviewer number 2 rears their ugly head, in tech bro hackathons, and in rude comments about other disciplines. 
In the 1930s, Ernest Rutherford claimed you can put science in two categories “physics and stamp-collecting” :face_with_rolling_eyes: - this is the kind of long-lived superiority that causes serious broblems. 

## Systemic broblems
Where does this attitude come from? 
In academia more widely, we mentioned the competitive nature of the academic jobs market in the scramble for limited funding, and the trope of PI "rockstars" :face_vomiting: single-handedly making discoveries. 
Incentives are not set up to celebrate community science: first author papers count for more. 
In the USA, fraternities particularly nurture this attitude, but other countries certainly seems to manufacture their own brand, too. A lack of diversity at the top seems to cement it.

## The evolution of bros 
In Open Science in particular, a generous intepretation is that they've developed an aggressive debating style because they started out punching up against established professors. 
Some of whom might have made anti-Open-Science arguments that truly were weak excuses or defensive reactions. 
Even if this is true, it's clear that there is a need to outgrow this behaviour now. 
Otherwise brutal honesty comes across as more of an interest in brutality than honesty.

## Combating bropen science: keeping the honesty, and losing the brutality
We find the judgy attitude of some parts of the Open Science movement to be shortsighted and impractical.
Even though bros may want to improve science or think they are helping, they are often getting in the way of good work by putting others off.
We like that the paper gave practical advice on how to address rudeness and create a welcoming community and found the [buffet of open science]() idea is particularly ~~useful~~ delicious.
We recognise that to improve things there a need to be opinionated, but it is possible to be opinionated _and_ kind.
Similarly, criticism can have a place, but it is also necessary to listen to others (particularly in less powerful positions) when they tell you that there are barriers, and consider how you can lower them.

While we each have an opportunity to be welcoming, we also recognise that there are prominent people in certain communities who have a lot of power in directing the tone of dicussions and managing the behaviour of others.

## Combating bropen science systemically
We also discussed how insecure working conditions for researchers could contribute to the nastiness that is sometimes present in academia. 
Could more permanent contracts help, for example through pooled postdoc positions, like [Research Software Engineers](https://society-rse.org/) can be?
We also discussed making science generally more diverse.
There are some examples of good programmes in this space, for example [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and [Widening Participation Internships](). 
We also didn't want to reduce this to a pipeline problem, as barriers to diversity go beyond far this, for example childcare provision, and hiring policies.

## A missed opportunity
People who were drawn to Open Science because of it's potential to upend some of the perverse power structures in academia (for example by making sure people get credit for their work) find bropenscience not just rude and impractical, but deeply disappointing. 
If Open Science is about showing-off who has the resources to buy in the most fully, then it just mirrors the system they were hoping to dismantle.





#### Q3: What did you think about the suggested actions in the paper? Would you take these? Why or why not?

#### Room 1
- For instance, as a concrete action, we could have friends from english-speaking countries helping in reviewing english-written works before sending to conferences or journals.

#### Room 2
- #broprogrammer could potentially allienating 
- Rarely is the talk ever consider the economic dimension
    - The productivity question in academia for a certain amount of funding. How many jobs at the top with any sort of job security?
    - The socioeconomic background of the individuals who are driving the discussion do NOT like to discuss the system that gives them an edge.
- Making your work "inviting"
    - Accessible to new users, potential benefits to yourself
    - Thinking about how others may be reading your material while you actually generating your work.
    - Multiple-formats of material
    - "Accessible" is a weighted word with lots of requirements from a legal framework
- All of this was so much **easier** when research was done with a homogeneous population
- FOSS is **NOT** free
 a trap that limits action now.
- 

#### Room 4



#### Room 3
We all need to be prepared to call things out. We will get more of the behaviour that we accept if we don't.
