### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We want to try writing up the discussions, but we'd like to include input from everyone in the discussion.
So, we're trying a new thing: writing up our thoughts about the paper collaboratively.
We hope you'll join us in this experiment! 
The idea is to try to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view - if you want them to be!

We also hope that through doing this, we'll learn how to write collaboratively across this very geographically dispersed group with different backgrounds. 
We hope that will prepare us to collaborate on a perspective article later - if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: New sentences on new lines
One thing to keep in mind is that it's good to write every sentence on a new line. 
This helps us to keep track of what's being written in different versions of the documents.
On the left ("edit mode") these sentences are on new lines, but on the right ("view mode") they're on the same line.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

## Discussion
Each week, we split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### Writing things down is optional
This document is an experiment to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

The following are all good options:
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here as you discuss.
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here up to a week after the discussion at any time.
- :heavy_check_mark: Not writing any notes in here at any time.

#### What to write
Suggestions for what to write down (if you want to):
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about

### Suggested Questions 

#### Q1: (When) have you noticed or experienced a "bro"-like culture in Open Science, reproducibility, data science, or your area of work/study?


#### Room 1
- I have noticed (and I think I am sometimes guilty of perpetuating sometimes :grimacing:) jokes about (least) favourite programming languages, which can come off as "you have to do it THIS way" even though I don't think that.
    - Also, I chose a fairly bro-y example [link](https://onewayroadtobeer.com/) in my introduction :beer:. My intuition is that this isn't as exclusionary because it doesn't imply a judgement, but I'm not confident that others will experience it in this way.

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, I'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then I'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.

## Feedback on the format
