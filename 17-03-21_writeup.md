### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We want to try writing up the discussions, but we'd like to include input from everyone in the discussion.
So, we're trying a new thing: writing up our thoughts about the paper collaboratively.
We hope you'll join us in this experiment! 
The idea is to try to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view - if you want them to be!

We also hope that through doing this, we'll learn how to write collaboratively across this very geographically dispersed group with different backgrounds. 
We hope that will prepare us to collaborate on a perspective article later - if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: New sentences on new lines
One thing to keep in mind is that it's good to write every sentence on a new line. 
This helps us to keep track of what's being written in different versions of the documents.
On the left ("edit mode") these sentences are on new lines, but on the right ("view mode") they're on the same line.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

## Discussion
Each week, we split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### Writing things down is optional
This document is an experiment to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

The following are all good options:
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here as you discuss.
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here up to a week after the discussion at any time.
- :heavy_check_mark: Not writing any notes in here at any time.

#### What to write
Suggestions for what to write down (if you want to):
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about

### Suggested Questions 

#### Q1: (When) have you noticed or experienced a "bro"-like culture in Open Science, reproducibility, data science, or your area of work/study?


#### Room 1
- I have noticed (and I think I am sometimes guilty of perpetuating sometimes :grimacing:) jokes about (least) favourite programming languages, which can come off as "you have to do it THIS way" even though I don't think that.
    - Also, I chose a fairly bro-y example [link](https://onewayroadtobeer.com/) in my introduction :beer:. My intuition is that this isn't as exclusionary because it doesn't imply a judgement, but I'm not confident that others will experience it in this way.
    - I quite agree - in our discussion in the break out room, I shared my experience about something happend a couple of years ago @ PyCon Italia. We used to have this social event called PyBeer. After receiving a very good feedback on this point, we decided to change the name to increase the inclusiveness. 
    - During my PhD I had a very bro-y colleague. Luckily he was receptive to criticism of his language and behaviour and did repond, slowly perhaps.
-  We spoke about the importance of dicussion in raising awareness of biases, and about how bias extends from the more clearly identifiable (perhaps gender), to more complex inclusivity issues, say geographic, socioeconomic, ethnic.

#### Room 2
- Sometimes its from women, who have mirrored the aggressive men-dominated software culture
- Often brogramming is strongest in peer code review sessions

#### Room 3
- Addressing issues in open science also means addressing issues outside of academia. 
- People who enforce open science as only working in one particular way prevent people from trying. A sense that it is the only way forwards; instead we need a buffet approach - improve things bit by bit, using what is available rather than seek perfection in a single go.
- Examples of communities around programming languages (e.g. R and Python) where both languages are 'open' but if the community is unhelpful then it will not encourage people to learn that language. 
- [Whiteness in Statistics](https://joelemartinez.com/2016/12/28/whiteness-in-statistics/)
- Addressing issues of 'bros' seems to be generally about addressing rudeness and shortsightedness which is particularly important in the context of science (and open science since it is publicly accessibe). A good scientist should be open minded and look at all POV and evidence to be sure about their results, including POVs of other social groups. Being open and considering all evidence is a part of good science overall and should be discussed as such.

#### Room 4
- People sometimes put things in a way that's complicated on purpose, or try to show-off due to a cut-throat environment in academica.
- People's think that they have a great idea, but actually they are don't. 
- Even if you have a completely fair process in some small part of the system, it's still built on the biased things things in the past. E.g. Open science is part of science, so that's why it's an issue. 
    - Historical gender imbalance: "Recoding Gender" by Janet Abbate, 2012 MIT Press
- In tech bro culture, especially in hackathons there is a really competitive atmosphere. Putting other people down, being very condescending. 
    - How to oppose: efforts like Black Girls Code, R ladies, etc.
    - Who has a weekend to spend doing unpaid computer programming at hackathon? 
- Pipeline issue: where are we getting PhD students from? This has to be looked at as a lens to solve problems, not an excuse! Some things do work (e.g. widening participation)
- A lot of childcare structure (e.g. travelling for conferences, etc) can stop people later in careers.
- Different ways of participating in Open Science movements: what's seen as cool, knowing stuff, sharing stuff, building communities. 
  - how to recognise, reward, and incentivise these diverse contributions? Not just through e.g. REF but culturally.
  - "pile-ons" where people try to correct speaker
  - judgemental presentation of "my way is awesome, you're stupid if you don't do it" is not very persuasive or useful
- Being opinionated indicates enthusiasm, but doesn't need to spill over into dogma or offensiveness 
  - :fire: :fire: :fire: "people who claim to be brutally honest are more interested in being brutal than being honest"
  - opinionated _and_ kind :heart:

#### Q2: What do you think about the idea that "bros find it hard to understand – or accept – that others will have a different lived experience"?

#### Room 1
- It is natural, very ingrained ideas are difficult to change.

#### Room 2
- Bro-culture: aggressive & performative, overly self-confident, for Americans - associated with fraternity culture. Always told they have something to contribute and not prone to self-reflection
- It doesn't really matter whether they understand or not, they are getting in the way of good work.

#### Room 3
- People seem to think they're being helpful (e.g. correcting people's English when they are asking for advice on another matter). "They meant well". 
- These ideas that people who are brilliant scientists or programmers etc, but they are *so brilliant* they can't be fired. 

#### Room 4
- Fair assessment of 'bros' attitude - obsessed with dogma of enforcing given standards (may not be intentional)
- This "attack mode" attitude developed from defending their work (for example)
- (:+1: correct me Natalie if I haven't written everything down)
- 


#### Q3: What did you think about the suggested actions in the paper? Would you take these? Why or why not?

#### Room 1
- For instance, as a concrete action, we could have friends from english-speaking countries helping in reviewing english-written works before sending to conferences or journals.

#### Room 2
- #broprogrammer could potentially allienating 
- Rarely is the talk ever consider the economic dimension
    - The productivity question in academia for a certain amount of funding. How many jobs at the top with any sort of job security?
    - The socioeconomic background of the individuals who are driving the discussion do NOT like to discuss the system that gives them an edge.
- Making your work "inviting"
    - Accessible to new users, potential benefits to yourself
    - Thinking about how others may be reading your material while you actually generating your work.
    - Multiple-formats of material
    - "Accessible" is a weighted word with lots of requirements from a legal framework
- All of this was so much **easier** when research was done with a homogeneous population
- FOSS is **NOT** free

#### Room 3
- Some of the actions or suggestions of how to 'do' Open Science 
- Importance of leadership in setting the tone of an environment. There are prominent people in certain communities (methodological, programming languages)

#### Room 4


### Bonus Question: What change would you like to see? Who has the power to make that change?

#### Room 1

#### Room 2

#### Room 3
We all need to be prepared to call things out. 

#### Room 4


### Misc discussion

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, I'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then I'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.

## Feedback on the format
Please feel free to leave us some notes below on how the discussion group went for you this time, positive or negative, and any suggestions to improve (you can always [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) instead):

* Suggestion here
* Another suggestion here
* In my room we got involved in a discussion on Q1 and didn't consider the other Qs until near the end, so it'd be helpful to consider other ways to capture the discussion that mean we think more holistically (maybe putting one space for notes after all the Qs, or encouraging us to read the Qs out at the start of the breakout, or something)
