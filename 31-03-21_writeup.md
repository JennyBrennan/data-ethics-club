### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

We also hope that through doing this, we'll open up the possibility for more collaborative writing together in the future, e.g. through a perspective article.
That's if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### Writing things down is optional
This document is an experiment to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

The following are all good options:
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here as you discuss.
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here up to a week after the discussion at any time.
- :heavy_check_mark: Not writing any notes in here at any time.

#### What to write
Suggestions for what to write down (if you want to):
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about

### Discussion

#### Room 1

##### Q1: What do you understand 'dataism' to be, based on this piece?

##### Q2: In the battle between privacy and health, will health win? Is improved health care what makes us believe in 'dataism'?

##### Q3: Harari says that algorithms will no longer discriminate against us for belonging to a particular group, but because of patterns it sees in us that deviate from the norm. He goes on to say that this will make it difficult to create political movements to fight oppression because your oppression will be indivdiualised. What are your thoughts on this perspective?

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, I'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then I'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.
