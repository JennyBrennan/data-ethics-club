### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

We also hope that through doing this, we'll open up the possibility for more collaborative writing together in the future, e.g. through a perspective article.
That's if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

## Writing and discussion
Each week, we split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### :information_source:  Notes on writing
#### Writing things down is optional
This document is an experiment to find out if it's possible to capture some of these discussions as we do them. 
But we don't want to do that at the expense of flow, honesty, or enjoyability.

The following are all good options:
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here as you discuss.
- :heavy_check_mark: Writing some notes in here up to a week after the discussion at any time.
- :heavy_check_mark: Not writing any notes in here at any time.

#### What to write
Suggestions for what to write down (if you want to):
- Any interesting quotes from the discussion
- Links to other material that came up in the discussion
- Parts of the reading material that you felt particularly strongly about

### Discussion

#### Nina's Summary
- Interview with philosopher and historian Yuval Noah Harari.
- Humans are obtaining a God-like power to create consciousness
- Algorithms are being given a God-like power and trust to tell us how to live our lives, and also to impact our lives.
- Talks about positives and negatives, for example positively personalised medicine to give you the best treatment with the least side effects and negatively, the possibility for discrimination to become personalised, which would be difficult to organise against and fight.

#### Suggested Questions

- **Q1**: What do you understand 'dataism' to be, based on this piece?
- **Q2**: In the battle between privacy and health, will health win? Is improved health care what makes us believe in 'dataism'?
- **Q3**: Harari says that algorithms will no longer discriminate against us for belonging to a particular group, but because of patterns it sees in us that deviate from the norm. He goes on to say that this will make it difficult to create political movements to fight oppression because your oppression will be indivdiualised. What are your thoughts on this perspective?
- **Bonus Question:** What change would you like to see on the basis of this piece? Who has the power to make that change?

#### Room 1: Robin, Ruth, Miranda, Chris, Emma T

##### Q1
- Dataism is the idea that algorithms have the right answer. 
- A principle that guides people's behaviour.
- Harari's not really interrogating how data science fits into existing power structures, but he's separating data science as a separate category/system of authority. 
- Religion is much more than just an authority system.
- Clara in the sun - book about an AI friend: why are we trying to create as near human a robot as possible. AI wouldn't have free will.
- Seems very placed in the data-science hype.
- In European law, you're entitled to some sort of explanation and a human in the loop decision for an important. 
    - But a lot of people don't know that. They're not sure of their rights. 
    - Metaphor as algorithm as tertiary priest :fire:
    - The authority is still the company, the person using the algorithm, etc.
- How people interact with authority system (Small Gods 
- Terry Pratchet), religion takes over rather than the God, i.e. how people interact with authority and the "source" of authority itself.
- Written as hyperbole to raise concern (a distopian future).
    - But is it only distopian? He seemed to welcome it in some places.
    - The utopia that is being created is only good for some people. The scarier thing is that people will want it.
- Who/what do we accept decisions from without question?
- "most effective story" seems distopian and accurate
- Who gets to manage health data? He just assumes that will end up with Facebook. Not necessarily true
- The idea that Google knows more about me than I do is not true at least based on my targeted advertisements! :+1: 
- Unhelpful narratives?
    - There exists a person who makes a decision and we just trust that.
    - There exists an algorithm and we just trust that
    - There exists governance out there and we just trust that.
- What would be a helpful narrative?
    - Good information literacy, understanding of your rights as a human being. Ensure that people have a platform to find out how they are being effected. Which means data transparency but also ways of discussing it.
    

##### Q2

##### Q3
- Why can't the common group be "discriminated against by algorithm"? Depending on the system, people might question it.
- Won't the algorithm be making decisions based on underlying data that describes our existing groups anyway?
- What if a subgroup is oppressed that wasn't already identified. If you "like" "curly fries" then you have very high intelligence [link](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf). Curly-fry haters would be unlikely to rise up in a group. 
- You might not know that there are other people out there like you. You might not know why the decision was made. 
- How to protect against it: make socioeconomic status a protected group.
- How to combat the digital divide? Not too many solutions in terms of the finance sector, for example.
- Do we think that UBI would fix some of these issues?
    - How does this fit into existing cultural norms (working long weeks)?
    - Productivity just increases, rather than having more leisure time (historically).
- Google/Facebook store data outside the country to protect individuals from their government.
- There are useful things that you can do with tools, but they're not god-like.

##### Bonus question

##### Misc

#### Room 2: Huw, Matt, Paul, Milli, Emma

##### Q1
- Speaking a lot without saying all that much.
- Quasi-religious authority of "data" or maybe more appropriately, the algorithm. 
- 'Religious' in the sense of an abdication of personal responsibility to something greater than (at least bigger than) the individual
- Utopian/dystopian fatalism

##### Q2
- Regarding Health & Privacy, need to put in codes of professional & moral standards if corporations violate that.
- How to define the liability of software.
- How many thousands of non-professionals are out there producing software. 
- Profileration of machine learning usage without expertise to ensure ethical conclusions result from the algorithms.
- One can also say that there are good business reasons for following standards but the incentives are right now very much tilted towards maximizing short to profits
- Unclear about any solutions.

##### Q3
- The question of discrimination: individually or as part of a group?
- We still operate in meatspace, so lots of peer to peer interactions
- not a lot of talking about the physical systems
- Do we have enough server space to create God, ala the Koa-toa?
- Internet has existed outside of the "platforms"
- Currently polarization in politics but still far away from individualization

##### Bonus question
- Don't trust those who have pleasingly sounding "BigHistory" takes

##### Misc
Some cool books:
Mindf*ck by Christopher Wylie 
Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil (:+1:)

Is there enough server space to create a God?

#### Room 3
##### Q1
- Dataism as a way of transferring our lack of understanding. e.g. being 'blessed' or 'cursed' by an algorithm. 
- But doesn't necessarily engender belief - do people really 'believe' in algorithms.
- Perhaps its more aligned to humanism than religion. Humanism - you know yourself. Dataism - Google or Apple knows you best. 
- What is Ethics anyway?
Ethics has three tenants - we need all three together, which includes an external heirarchy
- The technology isn't actually as good as people think it is. 

##### Q2
- The drive for quantified self is strong. Does it matter how many steps you've done? Not necessarily, but you want to know. 
- 

##### Q3

##### Bonus question

##### Misc
The piece didn't seem to evoke fear about algorithms. It was more that this was an inevitable outcome, and perhaps a solution is just for us to be better educated about it. Inevitability of new technology panics each time something come around. 

Narratives are hugely important in framing how people think about AI. People only want it if it is as magical as people believe it is. Boiling frog analogy

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, I'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then I'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.

## Feedback on the format
Please feel free to leave us some notes below on how the discussion group went for you this time, positive or negative, and any suggestions to improve (you can always [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) instead). 
We do read these and make changes :sparkles:
