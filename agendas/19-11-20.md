## Agenda 19-11-20

We should talk about:
- [Issue 5: Choose dates for first meeting](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/5)
- [Issue 6: Should we set up a mailing list](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/6)
- [Issue 7: What should the format of meetings be like](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/7)

If we have time, maybe we will tackle some of the actions relating to these points too (e.g. setting up a mailing list or creating a document where people can find our upcoming meetings)
